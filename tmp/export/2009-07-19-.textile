title: Taipei Photowalk 2009
---

It is 4 am and I can't sleep as my feet are pretty sore from all the walking I did during Taipei photowalk, one of the 900 held worldwide. Kudos to Craig who took the lead to host Scott Kelby's second annual Worldwide photowalk in Taipei to which I immediately signed up and as expected it was immense fun to interact with great photographers,walking around and just taking random photos. Thanks a lot Craig.
