I absolutely enjoy reading <a target="_blank" href="http://headfirstlabs.com/index.php">Head First Series books</a>. I first came across _Head First Java_ when my colleague introduced it to me and I absolutely loved it. Although I already had my Java basics in place, reading this book was pure fun. I almost made my mother worried when I went hysteric while reading the funny quotes n pictures in the book. <font size="1">[Ok it was the picture of a Dog object talking to his owner who puts him in an ArrayList and it comes out as Object object ...the dog says "*_I hope it doesn't hurt. And whats so wrong with staying an Object? OK I can't fetch, sure but I can give you a real nice hashcode_*" =))=))=)) ]</font>
By no means are these normal books. They have put everything from a hand drawn pictures to black-n-white pictures from yesteryear movies [often with quotes which can get you roll-on-the-floor laugh] and hand written notes to explain java code. Besides funny pictures and quotes I like the Fireside chats and Java Tabloid TV. They are absolutely hilarious.  The whole idea is to make learning a entertaining activity. They use attention grabbing tactics to help readers remember the key concepts.

Initially the Head first series had a focus on Web applications development using Java technologies but now they are trying their hands on other topics with Head First books written for AJAX, SQL, PMP [Ok thats not a technology... its Project Management & Planning] and soon-to-be-released Head First C#.

Thanks to HF creators Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates for making such a wonderful book. Learning Java has become a fun exercise [Actually teaching too. I am currently teaching Java to some of the new joinees in my company and HFJ has made my life easier by 100 times. Given that I am teaching to my new Taiwanese coworkers, HFJ's simple lnguage, funny anecdotes are like alt+space in Eclipse].

Last but not least O'Reilly has a great team in place and already making Head First a big success by publishing more HFs.

So my advise is to go grab a copy of any Head First book today and read it. You will love it. [I have purchased all the HF java books and now eagarly waiting for my Head First PMP to arrive 8->]

[Update on Typhoon: Well, typhoon didn't have much of a impact on north of Taiwan..thankfully. Just had couple of showers thats it. Just missed out on making a good use of my weekend. I was sitting all the time in my appartment as everyone was advised to stay at home. ]
