title: Blogtoberfest and later
---

Life is flying by at incredible pace lately. 3 weeks have already passed since I was at Blogtoberfest, having super delicious food and sipping thai rum with some of the most creative minds I have ever met. I was quite eager to meet everyone whose blogs I have been following for well over an year now. Huge huge thanks to MJ and Hui Chen for arranging this smashing event.
