Last couple of weeks went at a feverish pace. I was busy traning a new joinee, fire fighting in one project and getting oriented to new office. So I was kind of wore out because all of this. Come this weekend I already had my plans in place as mentioned in my previous post. Friday evening I rented some DVDs and enjoyed some really good movies. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104291/">Forever Young</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105323/">Scent of a woman</a>. I have always loved Mel Gibson movies and Forever Young was no different. I have seen Scent of a woman couple of times and I absolutely savor watching Al Pacino's performance which fetched him Oscar in 1992.

Saturday was a great day but I absolutely couldn't help myself out of my bed. Haven't you ever had this feeling when you don't want to move a muscle, just lie down in your bed, look into a distant car or street and watch people go about their life and think about what they would be doing in coming hours. Well I do have these kind of feelings time to time.

Come Sunday we again had a wonderful day. This seldom happens in Taiwan. Back to back days with a sun shining in the sky and no trace of clouds. I wanted to go out but the only place that I usually go out for a one day trip is Taipei. Going to Taipei for a day tour usually drains me out. So I decided againest it. Couple of months before I had read about a coffe shop near a reservoir called  <a target="_blank" href="http://lakesidecoffee.com">Lakeside Coffee</a> .

The idea of sitting beside a lake and sipping a cup of coffee is exactly what I could ask for after a hectic week so I decided to check it out.

It was supposed to be close to my place about 20 to 30 mins but only after asking several people and missing a turn or two I reached this beautiful place after 1 hr and 15 mins. Ok I know I was slow... lol ... but I was just trying to enjoy the view on display and breathing fresh mountain air.

I missed a turn and crossed this bridge. I was fortunate to realize early that I was heading a wrong way so promptly took a U-turn.

Wouldn't mind to miss some turns if it leads me this view.

Finally I found it. Small board of Lakeside Coffee. It took me some time to find this little place but was worth the trouble.

Looks small but it hosts three floors and a big open seating place facing lake in the background. Given it was Sunday and how Taiwanese people love to eat outside on the weekend I hardly expected to get an unoccupied table. And I was right. I had to wait for good 20 mins for my turn. I utilized my time to take some pictures inside the restaurent waiting area.

Beautiful framed pictures of the lake and surroundings of the restaurent.

Surprisingly menu was bi-lingual :D So instead of relying on my gut feeling I was actually able choose something ... lol. Saw an interesting name on the card and oredered it. Twin Peaks Lakeside Special Coffee. I wasn't sure what "twin peaks" actually meant untill the waiter served me this lol.

Drinking water is usually served with a natural flavour here. This one was warm with fresh piece of lemon and orange.

I had plenty of time to kill so clicked some scenic photos.

Sun was going down real fast. It was beautiful and very calm out there.

It was time to leave. I saw a passenger jet passing in the distant sky, soaring toward its destination. I felt refreshed and recharged.It was refreshing experience and it came from simple pleasures of riding in mountains, breathing fresh air and watching nature.
