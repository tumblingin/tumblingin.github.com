  popular. Jenny and I posted a slightly longer version, from a more recent talk we
  did at the PMI Mass Bay chapter. We added a couple of slides on what you can do
  about project problems. We're working on videotaping an upcoming one. If we get
  a video online, we'll definitely post it.

content: It sure is a wonderful presentation Andrew. Thank you so much.I also checked
  out the latest one. The problems that I can identify my project are Scope Creep
  and Fixed deadline no matter what. But I believe by doing right things we can bring
  it on the right track. Meanwhile I would love to see video presentation on the same
  topic in the near future. Kindly let me know when it is up on your website. By the
  way I have bought your book "Applied Software Project Management" but I have a dilemma
  now. Since I am already reading Head First PMP, ofcourse after undergoing a formal
  training of 40 hr course by PMI certified mentor, which order would you recommend?
  HF PMP first and then ASPM or ASPM first and then HF PMP?

  guess, for instance www.google.cm takes me to netflix and not agoga.com


  I saw few comments on advertising here and how people make money out of it. I have
  a parallel view about the way people make money thru advertising on net. Its not
  always that u have to click on an ad link for the advertiser to pay money to the
  website owner. In a type of adv like brand building, the organisations aim is to
  create an awareness about the company name, logo or product brand to the cosumers.
  They are not necessarily selling anything on the net, there aim is "people should
  visualize us when they see this logo" (nike is the best example here). in such cases,
  the advertisers pay the website owners for diplaying thier ad irrespective of if
  there link was clicked or not. Definitely clicking on the ad would fetch them bigger
  profit, but its not the only way to earn thru ad.


  just my cent :)'

  ya its not exactly *.cm wild card setup but most of *.cm will redirect to agoga.com
  ... it was intresting when i tried popular websites n they were redirected to some
  other sites for example google.cm was redirected to persoft.com n there are legitimate
  sites for apple.cm and microsoft.cm

  But anyways your point is correct about brand building ... they may not be selling
  through ads just plain traditional advertising :D'

  I know this isn''t really the point of your post, but one of the tools I have found
  useful to keep me (and my family) away from domain squatters is opendns.com. They
  offer a free (ad supported) alternate DNS system. They essentially do something
  similar to what Kevin Ham does, but the ads are always tasteful, you get a link
  to the right site, and they offer services (like blocking phishing sites, etc.)
  Normally, I never see it, unless I mistype a domain name, then I get the right link
  and a couple of adsense style ads on the side. Check it out.'

  if i may respond to your thoughts about flickr and blogging; of course you know
  that basically my flickr account is for the purpose of hosting my blog photos.  i
  use the Flock browser because it is flickr aware and i can use it to capture a photo
  and link back to the photo page (in accordance with flickr''s TOS). the normal size
  is 500 x NNN and that is a good width for WP blogs.  that is how the photos are
  hosted on our blog.


  take care'

  The fan-shaped garage looks interesting in the photos I''ve seen of it, but every

  got on a train and gone past it, it''s been open. It''s pretty terrible that in
  5 years living in Changhua, I still haven''t been inside, even though I can walk
  to it in 20 minutes.


  There''s a few really nice temples hidden away on the mountain/hill behind Baguashan
  that are quite interesting and very quiet. There''s also an abandoned high school
  about 2 minutes walk from the C-119 that is fun to explore.


  Maybe we should organise a blogger trip to Changhua one day and I can show you guys
  a few places that have yet to make it onto the tourist trail.'

  Weeks before the trek were forgettable. You guessed it right. I didn''t really find

  enjoying the views and stopping on almost every turn of the trail. So it was all
  fun for me.

  Feifengshan is located in the north-west of taiwan in Hsinchu County. Yo can get

  In fact I am also a Kerala man at heart. As you can see from the pictures above
  I am not a beach/water person either. To tell you the secret, the reason we went
  to Goa was cheaper booze :P

  I had thought of reviewing Indian food situation in Taiwan sometime back but truth
  to be told it is pathetic. I gave up on them long time ago. All of the so called
  Indian restaurants I have been so far are either run by non-indians or food is prepared
  to suite to Taiwanese people''s taste. But this was the case in my first couple
  of months after coming to Taiwan. I hope the quality is improved now and I also
  need to see some newly opened Indian restaurants such as a one at a MetroWalk store
  in Jhongli, one of the biggest I have seen in Taiwan. It has been high on my list
  for quite a while now. Well I will try and check out as much as I can and let you
  know.

  btw I really wanted to meet you before you leave for Laos. It would have been great
  to see you at MJ''s party @ Blue Sky. Unfortunately I couldn''t make it.Wish you
  can come on this Friday @ Shao Hui in hukou.

  Take Care'

content: Leena &gt;&gt; Thanks sis &gt;:D&lt; That effect is both because of the lens

  the 50mm prime lens helps to blur out the things in the background. There could
  be more technical explanation but the fact is I'm also learning at the moment hence
  the kinda fuzzy or unclear explanation ;)

  Talking about the test match it is very hard to predict. Normally India looks formidable
  at home given the spin and home advantage but Australia has won a couple test matches
  in India and the last series played in India so the battle is going to be very interesting
  for sure. personally I am not worried about the result. Past couple of years Australia
  and India had some fantastic test matches and thats what I am looking forward to
  see again. The quality of cricket between these two countries is the most exciting
  thing in the present. Even Sachin Tendulkar has said recently that India-Australia
  rivalry is more important than India-Pakistan these days.

  Unfortunately I have no means to watch these matches here in Taiwan. Will you be
  able to catch any of them? If you will then I am sure you are going to have a great
  time.'

  You know, when I first purchased my camera, everyone said that I would want to learn
  on the 18-55mm lens and then I''d want to upgrade to a bigger and better lens. Of
  course, I have my eye on a few for the future, but I''m not dissatisfied in the
  slightest with the way my images have turned out with the lens I have right now.
  I must be doing something right because people keep writing to ask me what I''m
  using and I keep telling them I use the lens that came with the camera! Eventually
  (after the wedding and a new laptop) I will make a new lens purchase, but for now,
  I''m pretty happy with what I have. I''m glad to see that you are too!'

  - if you do decide in the future to upgrade, don''t go for the mid-range stuff -
  save a bit longer and go for the top of the line. Why? Because if you buy mid-range,
  a year later you''ll be wanting to upgrade again. And that gets expensive.


  I really like the golden like on the 2nd photo, and the soft feel to the 3rd temple

  Lukang, it appears to me now that whenever I announce things on my blog that I am
  going to do, something inevitably jinxes it. To cut the long story short I had to
  stay back at the home because we didn't have enough room on the car for everyone
  so only sister-in-law &amp; kids accompanied my in-laws to Lukang.

  every second while you can because times really does fly when you have a child around!  I
  vaguely remember Olivia's first year.  It's a big blur in my memory now.  I'm sure
  you are already doing it, but remember to take lots of photos and videos!

  here in Pune but yeah i must say things have been hyped a lot by the media...  I
  understand every life is precious but practically speaking only 16 deaths in a city
  dwelled by 40+ lakhs... n there is panic everywhere :O  .. 1000 people die of ciggerretes
  every year ... thousands die in pune itself out of so many diseases but people never
  discussed that!! leave diseases, so many innocents die just out of hunger, just
  of out lack of shelter... why didnt media cover that in front page ever? agreed
  that this is a air borne disease which is hard to cure so everybody wants to take
  precautions .. which is a good thing.. but there's nothing to feel panicky about,
  the way people are reacting to the situation here in pune.. anyways if one exercises
  regularly and maintains healthy habbits, he will probably not even realize when
  the virus hit him and was killed ruthlessly by the body's own soldiers ;) ... Precaution
  is always good - people should avoid going to crowded places, travelling and self
  medication... its just that they need not feel panicky... on a lighter note as they
  say .. "100 people get Swine Flue and the whole world wants to wear surgical masks...
  20 million people have HIV &amp; no one wants to wear a condom!!"

  The situation here seems to be improving with every passing day. In fact, it was
  never that serious as it was made to appear on television. Just like any other flu,
  H1N1 can be countered with simple precautions. If you have a decent immunity your
  chances of catching the infection are further diminished.

  Hopefully, this will be gone by November. (You can keep your plans intact.)'

content: ! 'Souvik &gt;&gt; I think it is not just about the numbers 16 out of 400k,
  it is the pandemic nature of H1N1 and with no 100% cure as of now is what makes
  people panic. In these early days if not controlled it can bring cities/states to
  a grinding halt.


  On the other hand media finally is a business and they work on sensationalizing
  things a bit more. I''m not defending media here. I''m not even qualified to speak
  for them. Spreading awareness about other killer diseases is paramount though but
  whether or not it is media''s primary responsibility is not for me to decide. Hunger
  and shelter are part of bigger problems which I don''t think I''m capable of debating
  on.


  You are right about exercising and healthy habits which basically applies to all,
  not just swine flu.Precaution indeed. My intention of posting this was not to cause
  any panic but to show my concern. If you got panicky impression then my apologies
  :) Thanks for your comment bro &gt;:D&lt;'

content: ! 'Thanks Robyn :) I’m following your blog all along. Just may not be commenting
  as much. We are all doing great here.

  Yeah I hadn’t been blogging for quite some time now. My daughter broke my mobile
  couple months ago which basically forced me to stop posting my mobile photos. Although
  I got another one soon but I couldn’t get it to post to same blog again. I also
  joined at a new place for work which requires 3 hr commute every day. So time is
  kind of precious commodity these days. Not that it wasn’t before but you know what
  I mean :)

  Good news is that I am going to host my own blog with my own domain name. In fact
  it is already setup and running. Just want to tweak the blog theme and certain aspects
  of it before I make it public. You will probably have to update link to my blog
  if you have it.

  Thanks for your comment and have a nice time

  - Ashish'
