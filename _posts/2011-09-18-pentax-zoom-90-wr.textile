Few months ago my father-in-law gave me his 2 35mm film cameras that he hadn't been using for a while. One of them was <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Pentax+Zoom+90+WR&hl=en&um=1&ie=UTF-8&tbm=isch&source=og&sa=N&tab=wi&biw=1366&bih=643">Pentax Zoom 90 WR</a> and the other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_F70">Nikon N70</a>. Pentax one is a 35mm compact film camera with a 39-90mm fixed zoom lens. It is bit heavy for a compact camera. I like that the shutter is extremely quite. I might send to get it cleaned inside out as there is some dust inside the view finder and the lens as well. It takes great photos when the light is plenty so good for my lunchtime walk to snap few street photos. Last month I took few photos using it. Here are few select ones.
