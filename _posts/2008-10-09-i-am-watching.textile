<span style="font-family:Book Antiqua;font-size:1.2em;">Wood carving awards were held on 7th in the same building where I have been working since last July. I couldn't photograph any of the exhibits as I was supposed to be working. Hell with the dreadful office hours. In the late afternoon though as I sauntered through the first floor hall, I learned that the awards were over and most of the exhibits were taken away. Luckily my eyes were laid upon 2 exhibits that were placed at rather strange locations. One of them displayed below was placed under a staircase as if it was supposed to be discarded. Not an ideal condition to photograph but I tried my best. Still had to post process for sharpening and blurring. Here is the result. I'm not really big on post-processing but I believe this photo needed one and I did my best. Let me know what do you think.
