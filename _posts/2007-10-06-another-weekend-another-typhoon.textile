<p align="left">Taiwan is bracing for Typhoon Krosa on this weekend supposedly to impact more severly between late saturday and early sunday. With gusty winds upto 184 kmph and a radius of 300 kms it is expected to dump 44 inches of rain during its short visit to Taiwan.

I took a video of what typhoon was doing in my neighborhood using my camera but unfortunately couldn't upload it on my youtube account due to internet problem. Basically my appartment internet sucks :(  I guess its time to upgrade the connection speed. I will give a link as soon as I get it uploaded.

I am not sure if Typhoon is going to do be good for me or not. I had a nice trip planned for Sunday with my Taiwanese friends and their Zen meditation classmates to visit Taipei and surrounding picnic spots. I am not sure which places we were supposed to visit but as told by my friend Shayne and Jim it was supposed to be a relaxation trip with visits to some popular hot spring spots nearby Taipei, some traditional Tea shops and massage centers. But thanks to Krosa the organizers had to cancel it. Now I wasn't so sure if I could join them for this trip as I had caught cold due to sudden change in weather and had to take a day off on Friday :(( that was a real heartbreak since I have already spent my 7 paid holidays and any time off the work is going to cost me. Yes you read it right. 7 paid holiday ~X( This is excruciating especially given that my former company in India had 22 paid holidays along with 10 national holidays. Another interesting thing that I have observed is that these typhoons somehow understand english calender. They seems to visit taiwan only over weekends :P

Anyways I want to turn this house arest as a blessing in disguise. I wasn't getting enough time to read. So I guess I have perfect opportunity to grab a good book, a cup of coffee and lie down on my living room couch. Even couple of hours retrospection would be great use of time.
