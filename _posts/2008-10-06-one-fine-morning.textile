<span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:1.2em;">Yesterday, couple of minutes past 6 am I woke up to loud roars from a pack of stray cats fighting under my second floor apartment window. As long none got hurt I'm glad they did because it helped me to get ready for my 7:30 am train to Taipei. I got up,dressed, walked down to first floor,then on to another stairs to second floor of the section opposite to mine. Made an instant coffee and came back. Normally I spend my mornings continue reading whatever that I was reading before fall asleep but this particular morning I chose to spend my morning at the window instead.
Its been three months since I moved into this single room apartment.</span>
