Tomorrow i.e. 9th Nov India will celebrate one of the biggest festivals in the year called <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diwali">*Diwali*</a>*. *Also known as "Festival of Lights". Diwali is celebrated by all age groups. Everyone expresses their happiness by lighting earthen 'diyas' (lamps), cleaning and decorating houses, bursting firecrackers, sharing sweets, flowers and having family get together partaking in a sumptuous feast. Diwali is essentially a symbol of victory over darkness. By darkness it means all kind of negative forces such as wickedness, violence, lust, anger, envy, greed, bigotry, fear, injustice, oppression and suffering. Light is a metaphor of knowledge. Most civilizations recognizes light as gift of God and hence it has been a symbol of whatever positive in our world. Lighting little earthn lamps defeats this darkness.
