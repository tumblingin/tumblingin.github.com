Well not sure if you could get away with printing this blog post instead of the said email (especially since if you haven't received one, I presume) but I'm sure the original price should be reasonable for the kind of entertainment that is in store most notably the enactment of Hindu mythological epic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramayana">Ramayana</a>
