title: Dinner in Jhubei
---

One of the perks of working for a consulting company is that I get to dine with clients on a weekly basis. today after day long discussions, I had a dinner with Project Manager of one of our biggest clients. The clients office is located in Jhunan, South of Hsinchu County but since this guy lives in Jhubei where my office is located we decided to have dinner in Jhubei. Jhubei has excellent range of restaurants in the area known as 11 Street. Plenty of restaurants to choose from. In addition to traditional Chinese food restaurants, you can find Japanese, Italian, Continental and several Coffee/Tea shops. But we chose the nearest one from where we parked our car LOL.

This is the entrance of the restaurant. No sign, no board but a 2 floor restaurant with capacity for 100 people. Impressive.

Several table were placed outside to accommodate peak hour customers. Check out the two shoe shaped china clay flower pots hanging on the wall in the right top quarter of the image.
