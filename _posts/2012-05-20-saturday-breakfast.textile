On most weekends Susan and I have our breakfast together at a little breakfast restaurant around the corner of our apartment building. Sometimes after finishing up breakfast if Susan feels like I also take her to feed colorful koi fish in the the small water fountain place in front of the next building. This Saturday we did pretty much the same routine except we also had one little guy to accompany us, Ethan, Susan's one month old little brother.

Here Susan has pretty much finished her breakfast. Wait but the waffle is still there, right? She had surgically removed and finished all the blueberry jam out of her blueberry jam waffle and declared she was done.

On the way to feed fish. Susan shows her disapproval on the pause.

Fish watching.

This time I gave Susan an exercise to match colors on her dress with the different colored fish. I couldn't explain her why there isn't a green fish in there.

On our way back Susan insisted on pushing Ethan's stroller all by herself. I must admit she did a pretty good job.

Steering needs a bit of work though.

Here she is again disapproving the pause.

Although Ethan pretty much slept through the whole ritual I can not wait to see them walking, playing together.
