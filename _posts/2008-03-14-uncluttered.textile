Inspired by <a href="http://unclutterer.com/2008/03/12/creating-a-minimalist-workspace/" title="A minimalist workspace" target="_blank">guest post</a> at <a href="http://unclutterer.com/" title="unclutterer" target="_blank">unclutterer.com</a> from Leo of <a href="http://zenhabits.net/" title="Zenhabits" target="_blank">zenhabits.net</a> fame :D In reality this procrastination of clearing my desk was thrust upon me by my somewhat busy schedule but this afternoon when some gentlemen took a visit to our office I realized how uncluttered and gross my desk had become. I felt embarrassed. Didn't take me a great deal of time to clear my desk as I just dumped everything that was on the desk into a carton :P
