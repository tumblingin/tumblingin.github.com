Couldn't resist but post this video. My national pride came to fore :) Couple of days before I read some comments about India and living conditions in India and I was really sad but here is some good news. I was absolutely thrilled to see this video and how it is done. Irrespective of some sad things regarding the state of India, there are so many good and positive things about the country and its people. So go ahead and check out, there is more to India than people hoarding on trains and squatting on train tracks

I am absolutely proud to be an Indian.
