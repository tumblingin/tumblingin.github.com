This will be a very short post. First of all my apologies for not blogging. I have royally ignored blogging for long time. Apparently long enough to forget my own blog password. I can dish out a million excuses now but lets just do without them shall we?.
We are having CNY vacation in this part of world these days. While most of my taiwanese and expat friends would be traveling around Taiwan or abroad during this vacation, I would be spending it in Changhua. Most likely resting myself, watching Australian open and reading couple books that I saved for this particular vacation.
Just wanted to wish everyone a very happy chinese lunar new year and hope you have a great time during the vacation.Everyone else who isn't on vacation hope you have a great week.

PS: You gotta love the new wordpress dashboard :)
