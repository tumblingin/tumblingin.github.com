<p align="left" class="photoDescription">*INSIDE*: I was lying on my living room couch reading a book and having a cup of coffee. It was just serene watching Nature's fury outside and ofcourse enjoying cozyness of my snug little appartment.
*OUTSIDE*: Gusty winds upto 150 kmph howling like I had never heard before and ominous sounds emanated from various structures in the neighborhood. It was Typhoon Krosa on recent visit to Taiwan.

And finally I managed to upload the Typhoon video I talked about in my previous <a target="_blank" href="http://ashlin.wordpress.com/2007/10/06/another-weekend-another-typhoon/">post</a>. Phew ...

Typhoon Krosa as seen from my appartment window in Jhongli on 6th Oct 2007 around 2 PM.
